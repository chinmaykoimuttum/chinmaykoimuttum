 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 About Chinmay Koimuttum</h3></summary>
   I was born in Hyderabad, India on March 30, 2003. After spending the first few years of my life in Muscat, Oman, my family and I moved to Seattle, Washington, which has been our home for over 14 years. I was captivated by computer science and the immensely positive impact it could have on our world, and this led to me taking my first computer science class in high school. I was instantly hooked. In the years to come, I would go on to continue my education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, furthering my knowledge and interest in the subject I love on a daily basis. I am also deeply passionate about geopolitics, history, economics, finance, and ancient to modern polity, and I find great joy in looking at how computer science can directly apply to these fields!
